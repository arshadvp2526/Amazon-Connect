# 🟨 Instance Setup & Configuration  
## 📌 Topic 1: Creating an Amazon Connect Instance

Creating an Amazon Connect instance is the foundational step for setting up your cloud contact centre. This instance acts as the control center for managing all features, users, contact flows, telephony, and integrations within Amazon Connect.

---

## 🚀 What is an Amazon Connect Instance?

An **instance** in Amazon Connect is your isolated environment where:

- Users (agents, supervisors, admins) are created
- Contact flows, routing profiles, and queues are defined
- Phone numbers are claimed and assigned
- Integrations with Lambda, Lex, and other AWS services are managed
- Real-time monitoring and reporting are configured

Each AWS account can create **multiple instances** for different environments (e.g., production, staging, training).

---

## ✅ Prerequisites Before You Begin

- An **AWS account** with the necessary permissions (IAM)
- A region where Amazon Connect is available (e.g., US East, Asia Pacific)
- Basic understanding of your business use case (e.g., voice, chat, omnichannel)
- Optional: AWS CLI or IAM roles configured (for advanced automation)

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step: Creating an Amazon Connect Instance

### 🔹 Step 1: Sign In to AWS Console
- Go to the [Amazon Connect Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)
- Select your desired **AWS region**

### 🔹 Step 2: Start the Instance Creation Wizard
- Click **“Create an instance”**
- You’ll be guided through a series of configuration steps

### 🔹 Step 3: Identity Management
You’ll choose how users (agents/admins) will sign in.

| Option         | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Store users in Amazon Connect | Simple, in-console user management (best for small teams) |
| SAML 2.0-based authentication | Use your own identity provider (SSO with Okta, Azure AD)  |

> For training or demos, use **Amazon Connect user store**.

### 🔹 Step 4: Instance Alias
- Provide a **unique alias** (e.g., `acme-support`)
- This will become part of your instance’s login URL:  
  `https://acme-support.awsapps.com/connect/`

### 🔹 Step 5: Telephony Options
Choose your telephony capabilities:

- ✅ Inbound calls
- ⬜ Outbound calls *(enable only if needed — costs may apply)*

Later, you can **claim numbers** and assign them to flows.

### 🔹 Step 6: Data Storage Configuration

Amazon Connect stores call recordings, chat transcripts, and reports in Amazon S3.

You’ll configure:

| Data Type              | Destination        |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| Call Recordings        | Amazon S3 bucket   |
| Chat Transcripts       | Amazon S3 bucket   |
| Contact Trace Records  | Amazon S3 or Amazon Kinesis |
| Reports                | Amazon S3 bucket   |

> You can use default buckets or create new ones.

### 🔹 Step 7: Create the Instance

- Review all selections
- Click **"Create instance"**
- The instance is provisioned in a few minutes

---

## 🌐 After Instance Creation

Once your instance is created, you can:

| Task                        | Description                                         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Log in to Admin Console     | Manage users, contact flows, routing, etc.          |
| Add Phone Numbers           | Claim toll-free or direct-dial numbers              |
| Create Users (Agents/Admins)| Add or import users and assign roles               |
| Build Contact Flows         | Create IVRs and workflows for handling interactions |
| Integrate Services          | Add Lex bots, Lambda functions, CRMs, etc.         |
| Monitor & Test              | Place test calls and monitor agent activity         |

---

## 💡 Best Practices

- Use **meaningful aliases** (e.g., `brand-support`, `training-instance`)
- Create separate instances for **testing**, **training**, and **production**
- Tag your instance with **project names** or **cost centers** for billing
- Enable **CloudTrail** to track changes for audit purposes
- Ensure **IAM roles and policies** are restricted to follow least-privilege access

---

## 🧠 Summary

Creating an Amazon Connect instance is a quick but essential step that sets the foundation for everything else in your cloud contact centre. With a few guided steps, you can:

- Spin up a secure, scalable contact centre environment
- Choose your identity model
- Enable telephony and data storage
- Begin configuring agents, workflows, and integrations

Once deployed, you can manage and scale the instance entirely through the Amazon Connect web console or APIs.

# 🛡️ Understanding User Hierarchy & Security Profiles  
## 📦 Module: Instance Setup & Configuration – Amazon Connect

Amazon Connect uses a **role-based access model** to control what each user can view and do within the contact centre. This topic explains the **user hierarchy**, **security profiles**, and **permissions** that determine access within an Amazon Connect instance.

---

## 🧑‍💼 1. Who Are the Users?

There are three primary user types in Amazon Connect:

| Role         | Description                                                           |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent**     | Handles inbound/outbound customer interactions via the Connect interface |
| **Supervisor**| Monitors queues, agent activity, and live metrics                      |
| **Admin**     | Manages setup, users, contact flows, routing, analytics, and integrations |

These roles are **not hard-coded** — they are assigned via **Security Profiles**.

---

## 🔐 2. What Are Security Profiles?

Security profiles are **permission sets** that define what actions a user can perform.  
Every user must be assigned **at least one** security profile.

### ✅ Key Points:
- Users can belong to **multiple profiles**, but their **highest level of permission** applies
- Profiles include **default templates** and can be **customized** as needed
- Permissions cover areas like:  
  - Contact control (make/receive calls)  
  - Access to flows, queues, reports  
  - User management  
  - System settings

---

## 🧩 3. Default Security Profiles (Built-In)

| Profile Name       | Intended For       | Key Permissions                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Admin**           | System Admin       | Full access to all Amazon Connect features       |
| **Call Center Manager**| Supervisors    | Monitor queues, access reports, limited config   |
| **Quality Analyst** | QA Team            | Access to recordings, evaluations, transcripts   |
| **Agent**           | Frontline Agent    | Make/receive calls, view personal dashboard      |
| **Agent - Basic**   | Limited Agent      | Minimal access — basic call handling only        |
| **HR Profile**      | HR Users (optional)| View user metrics without interaction permissions|

---

## 🛠️ 4. Creating & Editing Security Profiles

To view or edit security profiles:

1. Go to **Amazon Connect Admin Console**  
2. Navigate to **Users > Security Profiles**  
3. Click **"Create Profile"** or select an existing one to modify  
4. Define permissions by checking or unchecking the boxes for each category:
   - Routing
   - Users
   - Metrics & Reports
   - Contact Control Panel (CCP)
   - Recordings, Transcripts, etc.
5. Save and assign this profile to users

---

## 🧭 5. Assigning Users to Profiles

When creating a user:

- Select their **Security Profile(s)**
- Assign their **Routing Profile**
- Choose the **Queue(s)** they should be associated with
- Assign their **Hierarchy Group** (optional, explained below)

> 🔑 You can also import users in bulk using CSV upload via the Admin Console.

---

## 🧱 6. Hierarchy Groups (Organizational Structure)

Hierarchy groups are **optional**, but useful for organizing users:

| Feature              | Description                                                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hierarchy Groups** | Allow logical grouping of users based on business units, teams |
| **Use Cases**        | Assign team leads, filter reports by team, apply access limits |
| **Levels**           | You can create multi-level groups (e.g., Region → Department → Team)|

Example:

Global Support
├── India Region
│ ├── Sales Team
│ └── Technical Support
└── US Region
└── Escalation Team


---

## 📊 7. Practical Example – How It All Connects

Let’s say you're onboarding a new support agent:

| Step                             | Action                                                  |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Create user                   | In Admin Console or via SSO/SAML                        |
| 2. Assign security profile       | Use “Agent” or “Agent - Basic”                          |
| 3. Assign routing profile        | Maps to queues and channels (e.g., Voice + Chat)        |
| 4. Assign to hierarchy group     | Optional — e.g., under "India → Support → Level 1"      |

# 🔁 Setting Up Routing Profiles and Agent Hierarchies  
## 📦 Module: Instance Setup & Configuration – Amazon Connect

To ensure customers are connected to the right agents quickly and efficiently, Amazon Connect uses **routing profiles** and **agent hierarchies**. This topic covers how to configure them for optimized contact handling.

---

## 🧭 1. What is a Routing Profile?

A **Routing Profile** defines:
- **Which channels** (voice, chat, tasks) an agent handles
- **Which queues** they are assigned to
- The **priority and order** in which contacts are routed to the agent

> ✅ It is essential for directing customer contacts to the right agents based on skill, availability, and workload.

---

## 🧩 2. Key Components of a Routing Profile

| Component          | Description                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Channels**        | Voice, Chat, and Tasks (can enable one or all)                   |
| **Queues**          | The customer-facing queues the agent will receive contacts from  |
| **Priority Order**  | Which queue’s contacts get routed first when multiple are active |
| **Concurrency**     | How many contacts an agent can handle simultaneously             |

---

## 🛠️ 3. How to Create a Routing Profile

### 📍 Step-by-Step:

1. Go to **Amazon Connect Admin Console**
2. Navigate to **Routing → Routing Profiles**
3. Click **“Create Routing Profile”**

### Fill in the details:

| Field                 | Example                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Name                   | `Support-Voice-Chat`                |
| Description            | Routing profile for Tier 1 support  |
| Channels Enabled       | Voice, Chat                         |
| Max Concurrency        | 1 (Voice), 3 (Chat)                 |
| Default Outbound Queue | Select an outbound queue            |
| Queues                 | Add one or more (e.g., “Billing”, “Tech Support”)|
| Queue Order            | Drag-and-drop to prioritize queues  |

4. Click **Save**  
5. Assign this profile to the relevant agents

---

## 👥 4. Assigning Routing Profiles to Agents

When creating or editing a user:
- Select the **appropriate routing profile**
- Ensure the user also has:
  - A **Security Profile**
  - Assigned **Hierarchy Group** (optional)

---

## 🧱 5. Agent Hierarchies

Agent hierarchy helps in **organizing agents** for:
- **Team-based performance tracking**
- **Queue-based routing**
- **Supervisor visibility and reporting**

You configure agent hierarchy via **Hierarchy Groups**:

| Level           | Example                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Level 1          | Region: India, US, Europe       |
| Level 2          | Department: Sales, Support      |
| Level 3          | Team: Tier 1, Escalation        |

> Amazon Connect supports **multi-level hierarchies** to reflect real-world org structures.

---

## 🗂️ 6. Use Case Example

### Scenario: Global Support Team

| Role        | Hierarchy             | Routing Profile        |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Rahul       | India → Support → L1   | `Support-Voice-Chat`    |
| Jane        | US → Sales → Escalation| `Sales-Voice`           |
| Priya       | India → Support → L2   | `Support-Voice`         |

- Rahul receives voice/chat from Tier 1 support queues  
- Priya receives higher priority voice calls from L2 queues  
- Jane handles only voice from Sales queue  

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

- Create **separate profiles** for:
  - Voice-only agents
  - Chat-only agents
  - Omnichannel agents
- Set **concurrency limits** carefully (e.g., chat concurrency = 3, voice = 1)
- Use **hierarchies** to assign supervisors and filter reports
- Keep profile names descriptive and consistent (e.g., `Voice-Sales-L1`, `Chat-Support-Tier2`)

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Element           | Purpose                                                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Routing Profile   | Defines channels, queues, and concurrency for agents           |
| Agent Hierarchy   | Organizes agents by team, department, or geography             |
| Queue Priority    | Determines which contact types agents receive first            |
| Integration Point | Linked during user creation and used for reporting and routing |

Proper setup of routing profiles and agent hierarchy ensures:
- Contacts reach the right agent quickly
- Load is balanced across teams
- Supervisors can monitor and manage performance effectively
