2. **Catalog the Data with AWS Glue**
   - Create a Glue Crawler to scan your S3 bucket and generate a schema

3. **Query with Amazon Athena**
   - Use Athena to write SQL queries against the CTR data
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT agent_username, queue_name, disconnect_reason, contact_duration
     FROM connect_contact_trace_records
     WHERE contact_date BETWEEN DATE '2025-07-01' AND DATE '2025-07-15'
     ```

4. **Connect Athena to Amazon QuickSight**
   - Open QuickSight and add Athena as a data source
   - Import query results as a dataset

5. **Create Visuals and Dashboards**
   - Use charts, graphs, pivot tables, and filters to build a dynamic dashboard
   - Share reports with stakeholders securely within your organization

---

### üìä **What You Can Visualize**

| Metric/Dimension        | Example Visuals                          |
