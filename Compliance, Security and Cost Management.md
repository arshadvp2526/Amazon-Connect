## 🛡️ Compliance, Security, and Cost Management

Amazon Connect provides several features to ensure that your contact center meets compliance requirements, protects sensitive data, and remains cost-efficient.

## **KMS Integration and Encryption of Call Data**

Amazon Connect integrates with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to secure sensitive customer data, including call recordings and transcripts.

### 🔐 How KMS Integration Works
- Encrypts data at rest using KMS.
- You can use the default AWS-managed key (`aws/connect`) or a Customer Managed Key (CMK).
- CMKs allow greater control:
  - Enable key rotation
  - Define access permissions
  - Monitor usage with AWS CloudTrail

### 🔄 Encrypting Call Recordings
- When call recording is enabled, the following are encrypted:
  - Audio recordings (.wav or .mp3)
  - Contact Lens transcripts (if used)

- You can configure the encryption key in:
  **Amazon Connect Console → Instance Settings → Data Storage → Encryption**

### 🔑 KMS Permissions
Ensure the Amazon Connect instance has access to the selected KMS key.

**Required service principal:**
```json
"Service": "connect.amazonaws.com"
```

**Required permissions:**
```json
[
  "kms:Encrypt",
  "kms:Decrypt",
  "kms:GenerateDataKey",
  "kms:DescribeKey"
]
```

### 📋 Best Practices
✅ Use CMKs for better access control  
✅ Enable automatic key rotation  
✅ Monitor key usage with AWS CloudTrail  
✅ Limit access to the KMS key only to necessary IAM roles and services  

Implementing KMS ensures encryption compliance and security for all sensitive customer interactions within Amazon Connect.
