# üü¶ Cloud-Based vs On-Premise Contact Centres

One of the most important decisions a business makes when setting up a contact centre is whether to go with a **cloud-based** or **on-premise** model. This section explains the difference, advantages, and limitations of both to help learners understand why cloud-based solutions like **Amazon Connect** are transforming the industry.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è What is a Cloud-Based Contact Centre?

A **cloud-based contact centre** is hosted entirely over the internet using a third-party service provider like **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It allows businesses to manage customer interactions (calls, chats, emails) via a web browser, without needing physical hardware or on-site servers.

**Examples**:

- Twilio Flex  
- Genesys Cloud  

---

## üè¢ What is an On-Premise Contact Centre?

An **on-premise contact centre** is installed and managed within the organization‚Äôs own physical infrastructure. The company is responsible for:

- Purchasing and maintaining servers, PBX systems, and software  
- Setting up data centers  
- Hiring IT teams for ongoing maintenance and updates  

**Examples**:  
- Cisco Unified Contact Centre  
- Avaya Aura
